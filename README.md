## Garbage Classification
Garbage Classification using a tflite model with Android Studio:

The Garbage Classification Dataset was avaliable in Kaggle I used the same to train and test using teachable machine and exported it as quantized tflite model

The images are classified into

->Cardboard

->Paper

->Glass

->Plastic

->Metal

The Accuracy of the model can be increased by training a better dataset(more data) 

The App requests for camera perms which on turning on allows you to capture images and make predictions 
Or you can select images from your device and do the same
